# Polynomial Regression using ggplot

Polynomial Regression is statistical analysis methods that aim to model relationships between independent variable and dependent variables is modelled as an nth order polynomial in x. It fits into a non-linear relationship between the value of both x and y.
It is used in most difficult regressions. It helps in improving the model very close to the data by increasing the order of the relationship between the dependent and independent variable. 



Formula for Polynomial Regression is 𝑦=𝛽+𝛽𝑥+𝛽𝑥2+ε
